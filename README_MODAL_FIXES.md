## ðŸ”´ ROOT CAUSE: jQuery Loading Order

**The main problem:** jQuery was loading AFTER scripts that use it.

This broke:
- âœ… Transfer modals
- âœ… Referral modals  
- âœ… All jQuery features

**Fix:** Moved jQuery to load FIRST in `templates/base.html`

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. jQuery Loading Order (CRITICAL)
**File:** `templates/base.html`
- Moved jQuery and Bootstrap to load before all other scripts
- Removed duplicate script tags

### 2. Transfer Modal
**File:** `pharmacy/templates/pharmacy/active_store_detail.html`
- Fixed HTML structure
- Removed duplicate modal
- Improved JavaScript using Bootstrap events

### 3. Referral Modal
**Files:** `templates/patients/patient_detail.html`, `consultations/views.py`
- Added hidden patient field
- Removed invalid form fields
- Enhanced doctor loading
- Fixed form validation
