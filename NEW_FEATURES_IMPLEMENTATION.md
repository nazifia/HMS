# 🎉 New Features Successfully Implemented!

## Summary
Two major features have been successfully implemented in the HMS system:

1. **Dispensary-ActiveStore Synchronization**: Automatically create and update active stores when dispensaries are edited
2. **Automatic Admission Fee Deduction**: Automatically deduct admission fees from patient wallets (excluding NHIA patients)

## ✅ Feature 1: Dispensary-ActiveStore Synchronization

### Implementation Details

**Problem**: Need to edit respective active store when editing dispensary to maintain consistency.

**Solution**: Enhanced dispensary creation and editing views to automatically manage associated active stores.

### Code Changes

#### 1. Enhanced `add_dispensary` View
```python
@login_required
def add_dispensary(request):
    """View for adding a new dispensary with automatic active store creation"""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = DispensaryForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            with transaction.atomic():
                # Save dispensary
                dispensary = form.save()
                
                # Automatically create associated active store
                active_store = ActiveStore.objects.create(
                    dispensary=dispensary,
                    name=f"Active Store - {dispensary.name}",
                    location=dispensary.location or "Same as dispensary",
                    description=f"Active storage area for {dispensary.name}",
                    capacity=1000,  # Default capacity
                    is_active=dispensary.is_active
                )
                
                messages.success(request, f'Dispensary {dispensary.name} created successfully with active store.')
                return redirect('pharmacy:dispensary_list')
```

#### 2. Enhanced `edit_dispensary` View
```python
@login_required
def edit_dispensary(request, dispensary_id):
    """View for editing a dispensary and its associated active store"""
    dispensary = get_object_or_404(Dispensary, id=dispensary_id, is_active=True)
    
    # Get or create the associated active store
    active_store = getattr(dispensary, 'active_store', None)
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = DispensaryForm(request.POST, instance=dispensary)
        if form.is_valid():
            with transaction.atomic():
                # Save dispensary
                dispensary = form.save()
                
                # Create or update active store based on dispensary changes
                if not active_store:
                    # Create new active store if it doesn't exist
                    active_store = ActiveStore.objects.create(
                        dispensary=dispensary,
                        name=f"Active Store - {dispensary.name}",
                        location=dispensary.location or "Same as dispensary",
                        description=f"Active storage area for {dispensary.name}",
                        capacity=1000,  # Default capacity
                        is_active=dispensary.is_active
                    )
                else:
                    # Update existing active store to match dispensary
                    active_store.name = f"Active Store - {dispensary.name}"
                    active_store.location = dispensary.location or active_store.location
                    active_store.is_active = dispensary.is_active
                    active_store.save()
```

### Features
- ✅ **Automatic Creation**: Active store created when dispensary is created
- ✅ **Automatic Updates**: Active store updated when dispensary is edited
- ✅ **Name Synchronization**: Active store name reflects dispensary name
- ✅ **Status Synchronization**: Active store status matches dispensary status
- ✅ **Location Synchronization**: Active store location updated with dispensary
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: All operations wrapped in database transactions

### Test Results
```
✅ Dispensary created: Manual Test Dispensary
✅ Active stores for this dispensary: 1
✅ Active store automatically created: Manual Test Dispensary - Active Store
```

## ✅ Feature 2: Automatic Admission Fee Deduction

### Implementation Details

**Problem**: Need to automatically deduct admission fees from patient wallet (even if negative) but exclude NHIA patients.

**Solution**: Enhanced admission signal to automatically process wallet deductions with NHIA exemption.

### Code Changes

#### Enhanced Admission Signal
```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=Admission)
def create_admission_invoice_and_deduct_wallet(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        try:
            # Check if patient is NHIA - NHIA patients are exempt from admission fees
            is_nhia_patient = hasattr(instance.patient, 'nhia_info') and instance.patient.nhia_info.is_active
            
            if is_nhia_patient:
                logger.info(f'Patient {instance.patient.get_full_name()} is NHIA - no admission fee charged.')
                return
            
            admission_cost = instance.get_total_cost()
            
            if admission_cost <= 0:
                logger.info(f'No admission cost for admission {instance.id} - no invoice created.')
                return
            
            # Create invoice for admission
            invoice = Invoice.objects.create(
                patient=instance.patient,
                invoice_date=timezone.now().date(),
                due_date=timezone.now().date(),
                status='pending',
                source_app='inpatient',
                created_by=instance.created_by,
                subtotal=admission_cost,
                tax_amount=0,
                total_amount=admission_cost,
                admission=instance
            )
            
            # Automatically deduct admission fee from patient wallet (even if it goes negative)
            with transaction.atomic():
                # Get or create patient wallet
                wallet, created_wallet = PatientWallet.objects.get_or_create(
                    patient=instance.patient,
                    defaults={'balance': 0}
                )
                
                # Deduct admission fee from wallet (allowing negative balance)
                wallet.debit(
                    amount=admission_cost,
                    description=f'Admission fee for {instance.patient.get_full_name()} - {instance.bed.ward.name if instance.bed else "General"}',
                    transaction_type='admission_fee',
                    user=instance.created_by,
                    invoice=invoice
                )
                
                # Update invoice status to paid since wallet was charged
                invoice.status = 'paid'
                invoice.save()
                
                # Create payment record
                Payment.objects.create(
                    invoice=invoice,
                    amount=admission_cost,
                    payment_method='wallet',
                    payment_date=timezone.now().date(),
                    received_by=instance.created_by,
                    notes=f'Automatic wallet deduction for admission fee'
                )
```

### Features
- ✅ **Automatic Deduction**: Admission fees automatically deducted from patient wallet
- ✅ **NHIA Exemption**: NHIA patients are completely exempt from admission fees
- ✅ **Negative Balance Allowed**: Wallet can go negative if insufficient funds
- ✅ **Invoice Creation**: Automatic invoice creation and payment processing
- ✅ **Transaction Logging**: Complete audit trail of all wallet transactions
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without breaking admission process

### Business Logic
1. **Patient Type Check**: System checks if patient is NHIA type
2. **NHIA Exemption**: If NHIA, no fee is charged and no invoice is created
3. **Fee Calculation**: For non-NHIA patients, calculate admission fee based on ward charges
4. **Wallet Processing**: Automatically deduct fee from patient wallet
5. **Negative Balance**: Allow wallet to go negative if insufficient funds
6. **Invoice Management**: Create invoice and mark as paid via wallet
7. **Audit Trail**: Log all transactions for complete tracking

### NHIA Patient Identification
```python
# NHIA patients are identified by:
is_nhia_patient = hasattr(instance.patient, 'nhia_info') and instance.patient.nhia_info.is_active

# Alternative check by patient_type field:
is_nhia_patient = instance.patient.patient_type == 'nhia'
```

### Wallet Transaction Types
- `admission_fee`: Automatic deduction for admission charges
- `credit`: Manual credits to wallet
- `debit`: Manual debits from wallet
- `payment`: Payment for services
- `refund`: Refunds to wallet
