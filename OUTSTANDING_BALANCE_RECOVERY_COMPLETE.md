# 🎉 **OUTSTANDING BALANCE RECOVERY SYSTEM - COMPLETE!**

## 📋 **Problem Solved**

**Issue**: Patient admission showing ₦26,000 outstanding balance that needs to be dynamically deducted from wallet daily

**Screenshot Analysis**:
- **Total Admission Cost**: ₦30,000.00
- **Wallet Charges for this Admission**: ₦4,000.00  
- **Outstanding Admission Cost**: ₦26,000.00
- **Current Patient Wallet Balance**: ₦14,000.00
- **Total Wallet Impact**: ₦-12,000.00 (if all outstanding applied)

## 🚀 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Daily Admission Charges Command**

**File**: `inpatient/management/commands/daily_admission_charges.py`

**New Features Added**:
```bash
# New command line options
--recover-outstanding          # Enable outstanding balance recovery
--recovery-strategy STRATEGY   # Choose recovery strategy
--max-daily-recovery AMOUNT    # Limit daily recovery amount
```

**Recovery Strategies**:
- **`immediate`**: Recover all outstanding balance at once
- **`gradual`**: Recover one daily charge worth per day (default)
- **`daily_plus`**: Recover 50% of outstanding or daily charge (whichever is smaller)

### **2. Dedicated Outstanding Balance Recovery Command**

**File**: `inpatient/management/commands/recover_outstanding_balances.py`

**Purpose**: Specifically handle outstanding balance recovery with fine-grained control

**Features**:
```bash
# Command options
--strategy STRATEGY           # Recovery strategy
--max-daily AMOUNT           # Maximum recovery per admission
--min-outstanding AMOUNT     # Minimum outstanding to process
--dry-run                    # Test mode
```

### **3. New Transaction Type**

**File**: `patients/models.py`

**Added**: `('outstanding_admission_recovery', 'Outstanding Admission Recovery')`

**Purpose**: Track outstanding balance recovery separately from regular daily charges

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Daily Charges Process**

```python
# Enhanced process flow
for admission in active_admissions:
    # 1. Process regular daily charge
    daily_result = process_admission_charge(admission, target_date, dry_run)
    
    # 2. Process outstanding balance recovery (if enabled)
    outstanding_result = process_outstanding_balance(
        admission, target_date, recovery_strategy, max_daily_recovery, dry_run
    )
    
    # 3. Combine and report results
    total_result = daily_result + outstanding_result
```

### **Outstanding Balance Calculation**

```python
def get_outstanding_admission_cost(self):
    """Get the unpaid admission cost that would impact wallet balance"""
    total_cost = self.get_total_cost()
    paid_amount = self.get_actual_charges_from_wallet()
    return max(0, total_cost - paid_amount)
```

### **Recovery Strategy Logic**

```python
if recovery_strategy == 'immediate':
    recovery_amount = outstanding_balance
elif recovery_strategy == 'gradual':
    recovery_amount = min(outstanding_balance, daily_charge)
elif recovery_strategy == 'daily_plus':
    recovery_amount = min(outstanding_balance, daily_charge, outstanding_balance * 0.5)
```

### **Real Data Test Results**

**Patient**: Jane Smith
- **Outstanding Balance**: ₦28,000.00
- **Daily Charge**: ₦2,000.00

**Strategy Results**:
- **Immediate**: Would recover ₦28,000.00 (100% of outstanding)
- **Gradual**: Would recover ₦2,000.00 (one daily charge worth)
- **Daily Plus**: Would recover ₦2,000.00 (50% of outstanding or daily charge)

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **1. Daily Charges with Outstanding Recovery**
```bash

# Limited recovery (with maximum daily limit)
python manage.py daily_admission_charges --recover-outstanding --recovery-strategy gradual --max-daily-recovery 5000
```

### **2. Dedicated Outstanding Balance Recovery**
```bash
# Test what would be recovered
python manage.py recover_outstanding_balances --dry-run --strategy immediate

# Gradual recovery with daily limit
python manage.py recover_outstanding_balances --strategy gradual --max-daily 3000

# Immediate recovery for all outstanding balances
python manage.py recover_outstanding_balances --strategy immediate
```

### **3. Automated Daily Processing**
```bash
# Add to cron job for daily automation
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/hms && python manage.py daily_admission_charges --recover-outstanding --recovery-strategy gradual
```
