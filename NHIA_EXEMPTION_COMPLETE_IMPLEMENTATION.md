# NHIA Patient Exemption - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of NHIA patient exemption from admission fees, lab tests payment, and radiology payment.

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Business Rule

**NHIA patients are exempt from:**
1. ✅ Admission fees (initial + daily charges)
2. ✅ Laboratory test payments
3. ✅ Radiology test payments

**Regular patients:**
- Pay all fees normally
- Wallet can go negative if insufficient balance

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Admission Fee Exemption (RESTORED)
**File:** `inpatient/signals.py`
**Lines:** 13-20

**Implementation:**
```python
# Check if patient is NHIA - NHIA patients are exempt from admission fees
if instance.patient.is_nhia_patient():
    logger.info(f'Patient {instance.patient.get_full_name()} is NHIA - no admission fee charged.')
    return

admission_cost = instance.get_total_cost()
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ NHIA patients NOT charged admission fees
- ✅ No invoice created for NHIA patients
- ✅ No wallet deduction for NHIA patients
- ✅ Logged for audit trail

---

### 2. ✅ Daily Admission Charges Exemption (RESTORED)
**File:** `inpatient/management/commands/daily_admission_charges.py`
**Lines:** 180-190

**Implementation:**
```python
def process_admission_charge(self, admission, charge_date, dry_run=False):
    """
    Process daily charge for a single admission.
    Returns the charge amount if successful, None if skipped.
    """
    # Check if patient is NHIA - NHIA patients are exempt from admission fees
    if admission.patient.is_nhia_patient():
        logger.info(f'Patient {admission.patient.get_full_name()} is NHIA - no daily charges applied.')
        return None
    
    # Check if admission was active on the charge date
    ...
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ NHIA patients NOT charged daily admission fees
- ✅ Automatic daily charge cron job skips NHIA patients
- ✅ Logged for audit trail

---

### 3. ✅ Outstanding Balance Recovery Exemption (RESTORED)
**File:** `inpatient/management/commands/daily_admission_charges.py`
**Lines:** 272-281

**Implementation:**
```python
def process_outstanding_balance(self, admission, charge_date, ...):
    """
    Process outstanding balance recovery for an admission using wallet-balance-aware strategies.
    Returns the amount recovered.
    """
    # Check if patient is NHIA - NHIA patients are exempt
    if admission.patient.is_nhia_patient():
        return Decimal('0.00')
    
    # Calculate outstanding balance
    ...
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ NHIA patients NOT charged for outstanding balances
- ✅ Recovery strategies skip NHIA patients
- ✅ Returns zero amount for NHIA patients

---

### 4. ✅ Internal Task Processing Exemption (RESTORED)
**File:** `inpatient/tasks.py`
**Lines:** 148-155

**Implementation:**
```python
def process_admission_charge_internal(admission, charge_date):
    """
    Internal function to process daily charge for a single admission.
    This mirrors the logic from the management command but returns structured data.
    """
    # Check if patient is NHIA - NHIA patients are exempt from admission fees
    if admission.patient.is_nhia_patient():
        return {'success': True, 'amount': None, 'reason': 'NHIA patient - exempt from charges'}
    ...
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ NHIA patients exempt in internal processing
- ✅ Consistent with management command
- ✅ Returns structured response

---

### 5. ✅ Laboratory Payment Exemption (NEW)
**File:** `laboratory/payment_views.py`
**Lines:** 15-35

**Implementation:**
```python
@login_required
@require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
def laboratory_payment(request, test_request_id):
    """Handle laboratory test payment processing with dual payment methods"""
    test_request = get_object_or_404(TestRequest, id=test_request_id)
    
    # Check if patient is NHIA - NHIA patients are exempt from lab test payments
    if test_request.patient.is_nhia_patient():
        messages.info(
            request,
            f'Patient {test_request.patient.get_full_name()} is an NHIA patient and is exempt from laboratory test payments. '
            'No payment is required.'
        )
        return redirect('laboratory:test_request_detail', test_request_id=test_request.id)
    
    # Get the associated invoice
    ...
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ NHIA patients cannot access lab payment page
- ✅ Redirected with informative message
- ✅ No wallet deduction for NHIA patients
- ✅ No payment processing for NHIA patients

---

### 6. ✅ Radiology Payment Exemption (NEW)
**File:** `radiology/payment_views.py`
**Lines:** 15-35

**Implementation:**
```python
@login_required
@require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
def radiology_payment(request, order_id):
    """Handle radiology test payment processing with dual payment methods"""
    radiology_order = get_object_or_404(RadiologyOrder, id=order_id)
    
    # Check if patient is NHIA - NHIA patients are exempt from radiology payments
    if radiology_order.patient.is_nhia_patient():
        messages.info(
            request,
            f'Patient {radiology_order.patient.get_full_name()} is an NHIA patient and is exempt from radiology payments. '
            'No payment is required.'
        )
        return redirect('radiology:order_detail', order_id=radiology_order.id)
    
    # Get the associated invoice
    ...
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ NHIA patients cannot access radiology payment page
- ✅ Redirected with informative message

## Important Notes

- NHIA exemption is **separate** from NHIA authorization system
- NHIA patients still need authorization for services outside NHIA units
- Exemption applies regardless of authorization status

### 2. **Wallet Behavior**
- NHIA patients: Wallet NOT touched
- Regular patients: Wallet deducted (can go negative)

### 3. **Invoice Creation**
- NHIA patients: NO invoices created
- Regular patients: Invoices created and marked as paid

### 4. **Payment Processing**
- NHIA patients: Redirected with message (cannot pay)
- Regular patients: Payment processing available
