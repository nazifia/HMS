# Pharmacy Purchases Template Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Context Variable Mismatch
**Problem**: The `manage_purchases` view was passing `page_obj` but the template expected `purchases`
**Solution**: Modified the view to pass both variables for compatibility:
```python
context = {
    'purchases': page_obj,  # Changed to match template expectations
    'page_obj': page_obj,   # Keep for pagination
    # ... other context variables
}
```

### 2. Missing Title Variable
**Problem**: Template used `{{ title }}` but view didn't provide it
**Solution**: Added `title` variable to context:
```python
'title': 'Manage Purchases',
```

### 3. Missing Payment Status Filter
**Problem**: Template had payment status filter but view didn't handle it
**Solution**: Added payment status filtering in the view:
```python
# Filter by payment status
payment_status = request.GET.get('payment_status', '')
if payment_status:
    purchases = purchases.filter(payment_status=payment_status)
```

### 4. Missing Pagination Controls
**Problem**: Template had no pagination controls despite using Paginator
**Solution**: Added comprehensive pagination controls:
- First/Previous/Next/Last buttons
- Page number navigation with range display
- Maintains search/filter parameters across pages
- Shows record count (e.g., "Showing 1 to 10 of 25 purchases")

### 5. Error Handling for Missing Relationships
**Problem**: Template could fail if purchase.supplier doesn't exist
**Solution**: Added fallback values using Django's default filter:
```html
<td>{{ purchase.supplier.name|default:"N/A" }}</td>
```

### 6. Select Related Optimization
**Problem**: View was causing N+1 queries for related objects
**Solution**: Added `select_related` for optimization:
```python
purchases = Purchase.objects.select_related('supplier', 'created_by').order_by('-purchase_date')
```

## Files Modified

## Features Added/Improved

1. **Working Search**: Search by invoice number, supplier name, or notes
