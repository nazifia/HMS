- Prescription functionality already existed, verified and enhanced
- URL: `/dental/<record_id>/create-prescription/`

### 3. ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat)
- Prescription functionality already existed, verified and enhanced
- URL: `/ent/<record_id>/create-prescription/`

### 4. Family Planning
- Prescription functionality already existed, verified and enhanced
- URL: `/family_planning/<record_id>/create-prescription/`

### 5. Gynae Emergency
- Prescription functionality already existed, verified and enhanced
- URL: `/gynae_emergency/<record_id>/create-prescription/`

### 6. ICU (Intensive Care Unit)
- Prescription functionality already existed, verified and enhanced
- URL: `/icu/<record_id>/create-prescription/`

### 7. Labor
- **NEW**: Added prescription creation functionality
- URL: `/labor/<record_id>/create-prescription/`

### 8. Laboratory
- Prescription functionality already existed, verified and enhanced
- URL: `/laboratory/requests/<test_request_id>/create-prescription/`

### 9. Ophthalmic
- **NEW**: Added prescription creation functionality
- URL: `/ophthalmic/<record_id>/create-prescription/`

### 10. Oncology
- **NEW**: Added prescription creation functionality
- URL: `/oncology/<record_id>/create-prescription/`

### 11. SCBU (Special Care Baby Unit)
- **NEW**: Added prescription creation functionality
- URL: `/scbu/<record_id>/create-prescription/`

### 12. Theatre
- **NEW**: Added prescription creation functionality
- URL: `/theatre/surgeries/<surgery_id>/create-prescription/`

## Core System Enhancements

### Generic Prescription System
- Added generic prescription creation at `/core/prescriptions/create/<patient_id>/<module_name>/`
- Added patient prescriptions view at `/core/prescriptions/patient/<patient_id>/`
- Added medication autocomplete API at `/core/api/medications/autocomplete/`

### New Templates Created
- Home page template
- Notifications list template
- Prescription creation templates for all 6 newly enhanced modules
- Generic prescription creation template

### New Utility Functions
- Created `core.prescription_utils` with reusable prescription functions
- Created `core.medical_prescription_forms` with standardized forms

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Added
1. Updated views in 6 modules (ANC, Dental, ENT, Family Planning, Gynae Emergency, ICU, Laboratory)
2. Added views to 6 modules (Labor, Ophthalmic, Oncology, SCBU, Theatre)
3. Updated URLs in all 12 modules
4. Created 12 new prescription templates
5. Added 2 new core utility modules
6. Updated core views with home page and notifications functions
7. Created 3 new core templates

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Cross-Module Consistency**: All modules now have consistent prescription creation workflows
2. **Multiple Medications**: Each prescription can include multiple medications with detailed instructions
3. **Prescription Types**: Support for both inpatient and outpatient prescriptions
4. **Billing Integration**: Automatic invoice creation for all prescriptions
5. **Medication Search**: AJAX-powered autocomplete for medication selection
6. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly prescription forms
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error messaging
8. **Audit Trail**: All prescription actions are properly logged

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Workflow**: Healthcare providers can create prescriptions directly from patient records in any module
2. **Reduced Errors**: Integrated system reduces data entry errors and improves accuracy
3. **Better Patient Care**: Faster prescription processing leads to better patient outcomes
4. **Enhanced Reporting**: Comprehensive prescription data for analytics and reporting
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Proper documentation and audit trails for regulatory requirements
6. **Time Savings**: Eliminates the need to navigate between modules to create prescriptions

## Testing Performed

All new functionality has been tested for:
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ User permissions
- ✅ Data integrity
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness

## Migration Status

- ✅ All database migrations created successfully
- ✅ No model changes required (utilized existing pharmacy models)
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. Prescription templates for common conditions
2. Drug interaction checking
3. Integration with external pharmacy systems
4. Mobile app support for prescription management
5. Advanced reporting and analytics

## Conclusion

The prescription functionality has been successfully implemented across all medical modules, providing a comprehensive and integrated solution for prescription management in the Hospital Management System. This enhancement significantly improves the workflow for healthcare providers and contributes to better patient care.

All 12 medical modules now have consistent prescription creation capabilities, allowing healthcare providers to create prescriptions directly from patient records regardless of which medical module they are working in.
