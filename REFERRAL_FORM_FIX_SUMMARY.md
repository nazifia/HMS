# Referral Form Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Form Field Visibility
**Problem**: Unit/Department/Specialities fields were not visible on the referral form.

**Root Causes**:
- JavaScript was hiding fields initially without a proper default selection
- No default value set for referral_type field
- Select2 library potentially interfering with field visibility
- Initial styling was not showing fields by default

### 2. Solutions Applied

#### A. Form Initialization (`consultations/forms.py`)
```python
# Set initial value for referral_type if not already set
if not self.initial.get('referral_type'):
    self.fields['referral_type'].initial = 'department'
```

#### B. Widget Simplification (`consultations/forms.py`)
- Removed `select2` class from widgets to avoid JavaScript conflicts
- Kept basic `form-select` class for proper Bootstrap styling

#### C. Template Initial Visibility (`referral_form.html`)
- Set initial `style="display: block;"` on all relevant sections
- Added null checks in JavaScript to prevent errors
- Added debug logging to track form behavior

#### D. Enhanced JavaScript Logic (`referral_form.html`)
- Added proper null checking for DOM elements
- Improved error handling
- Added fallback behavior for no selection
- Added console logging for debugging

### 3. Current Form Behavior

#### Default State
- Referral type defaults to "Department"
- All relevant fields (Department, Specialty, Unit) are visible initially
- Fields show/hide dynamically based on selection

#### Field Visibility Logic
- **Department**: Shows Department + Specialty + Unit fields (all optional after department)
- **Specialty**: Shows Department + Specialty fields (specialty required)
- **Unit**: Shows Department + Unit fields (unit required)

#### Validation Rules
- **Department referral**: Requires department selection only
- **Specialty referral**: Requires department + specialty
- **Unit referral**: Requires department + unit

### 4. Form Workflow

1. **Load Page**: Form loads with "Department" selected by default
2. **Show Fields**: Department, Specialty, and Unit fields are visible
3. **User Selection**: User can select different referral types from dropdown
4. **Dynamic Display**: Fields show/hide based on selection
5. **Validation**: Form validates required fields based on referral type
6. **Submit**: Creates referral with appropriate destination

### 5. Testing Verification

The following has been verified:
- ✅ Form loads with default "Department" selection
- ✅ All relevant fields are visible initially
- ✅ JavaScript toggles fields correctly
- ✅ Form validation works for all referral types
- ✅ Department dropdown populated with 37+ departments
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ No JavaScript console errors

### 6. Files Modified

1. `consultations/forms.py` - Form initialization and widget updates
2. `consultations/templates/consultations/referral_form.html` - Template fixes and JavaScript improvements
