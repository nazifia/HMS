# Department Dashboard Testing Checklist

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

This checklist will help you verify that all department dashboards are working correctly.

---

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Create Test Users for Each Department

You'll need to create users assigned to different departments to test access control:

```sql
-- Example: Create a test user for Laboratory department
-- Do this through Django admin or create users manually
```

**Required Test Users:**
- Laboratory staff user
- Radiology staff user  
- Dental staff user
- Theatre staff user
- Ophthalmic staff user
- ENT staff user
- Oncology staff user
- SCBU staff user
- ANC staff user
- Labor staff user
- ICU staff user
- Family Planning staff user
- Gynae Emergency staff user
- Superuser (for testing unrestricted access)

### 2. Create Test Referrals

Create at least 2-3 referrals for each department with different authorization statuses:
- âœ… Authorized referral
- âšª Not required referral
- ðŸŸ¡ Pending authorization referral
- ðŸ”´ Required authorization referral
