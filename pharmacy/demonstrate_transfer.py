    print("1. When a pack order is processed:")
    print("   - The system checks if all medications in the pack are available in the active store")
    print("   - If not, it attempts to transfer from bulk store to active store")
    print("   - Then it ensures medications are moved from active store to the respective dispensary\n")
    
    print("2. Transfer from Active Store to Dispensary:")
    print("   - Gets the user's associated dispensary (or uses default)")
    print("   - Verifies an active store exists for the dispensary")
    print("   - For each medication in the pack:")
    print("     * Checks if medication is available in the active store")
    print("     * If available, checks if it's also in the dispensary (legacy inventory)")
    print("     * If dispensary has insufficient quantity, creates a transfer for the shortage")
    print("     * If dispensary doesn't have the medication, creates a transfer for required quantity")
    print("     * Approves and executes the transfer immediately\n")
    
    print("3. Transfer Models:")
    print("   - MedicationTransfer: Handles transfers from bulk store to active store")
    print("   - DispensaryTransfer: Handles transfers from active store to dispensary\n")
    
    print("4. Key Features:")
    print("   - Automatic transfers when processing pack orders")
    print("   - Backward compatibility with legacy MedicationInventory model")
    print("   - Error handling that continues processing even if individual transfers fail")
    print("   - Audit trail through the DispensaryTransfer model")
    print("   - Respects user-dispensary associations when available\n")
    
    print("5. Benefits:")
    print("   - Streamlined workflow with automatic medication movement")
    print("   - Ensured dispensaries have required medications for prescriptions")
    print("   - Traceability with all transfers logged for audit purposes")
    print("   - Flexibility working with both new and legacy inventory systems\n")
    
    print("The implementation can be found in:")
    print("   - pharmacy/models.py in the PackOrder.process_order() method")
    print("   - Lines 879-987 contain the specific transfer logic\n")
