# Medication Transfer Logic Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the medication transfer logic implemented in the pharmacy system, specifically focusing on the movement of items/medications from the active store to the respective dispensary while maintaining existing functionalities.

## Transfer Process

The transfer logic is implemented in the `PackOrder.process_order()` method in `pharmacy/models.py`. The process involves the following steps:

### 1. Processing Pack Orders

When a pack order is processed, the system:

1. Checks if all medications in the pack are available in the active store
2. If not, attempts to transfer from bulk store to active store
3. Ensures medications are moved from active store to the respective dispensary
4. Creates a prescription from pack items

### 2. Transfer from Active Store to Dispensary

The key part of the logic that moves items from active store to dispensary works as follows:

1. **User Association**: The system tries to get the user's associated dispensary. If not found, it uses the first active dispensary.

2. **Active Store Check**: It verifies that an active store exists for the dispensary.

3. **Medication Availability**: For each medication in the pack:
   - Checks if the medication is available in the active store
   - If not available in active store, checks if it's in legacy inventory
   - If available in active store, checks if it's also available in the dispensary (legacy inventory)

4. **Transfer Execution**: 
   - If dispensary already has the medication but quantity is insufficient, creates a transfer for the shortage
   - If dispensary doesn't have the medication at all, creates a transfer for the required quantity
   - Approves and executes the transfer immediately

### 3. Transfer Models

Two transfer models handle the movement of medications:

#### MedicationTransfer
- Handles transfers from bulk store to active store
- Automatically executed when processing pack orders with insufficient active store inventory

#### DispensaryTransfer
- Handles transfers from active store to dispensary
- Automatically executed when processing pack orders to ensure dispensary has required medications

## Code Implementation

The transfer logic is implemented in the `process_order` method of the `PackOrder` model:

```python
def process_order(self, user):
    """Process the pack order and create prescription"""
    
    # Ensure that medications are moved from active store to the respective dispensary
    try:
        # Try to get user's associated dispensary
        if hasattr(user, 'profile') and hasattr(user.profile, 'dispensary'):
            dispensary = user.profile.dispensary
        else:
            # Use default dispensary
            dispensary = Dispensary.objects.filter(is_active=True).first()
        
        if dispensary:
            active_store = getattr(dispensary, 'active_store', None)
            if active_store:
                # For each medication in the pack, ensure it's available in the dispensary
                for pack_item in self.pack.items.all():
                    medication = pack_item.medication
                    required_quantity = pack_item.quantity
                    
                    # Check if medication is available in the active store
                    active_inventory = ActiveStoreInventory.objects.filter(
                        medication=medication,
                        active_store=active_store,
                        stock_quantity__gte=required_quantity
                    ).first()
                    
                    if not active_inventory:
                        # If not available in active store, check if it's in legacy inventory
                        try:

                            # If found in legacy inventory, we'll use that for dispensing
                            # No transfer needed in this case
                            pass

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Transfers**: The system automatically transfers medications from active store to dispensary when processing pack orders
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with legacy MedicationInventory model
3. **Error Handling**: Continues processing even if individual transfers fail
4. **Audit Trail**: All transfers are tracked through the DispensaryTransfer model
5. **User Association**: Respects user-dispensary associations when available

## Benefits

1. **Streamlined Workflow**: Medications are automatically moved to where they're needed
2. **Inventory Management**: Ensures dispensaries have required medications for prescriptions
3. **Traceability**: All transfers are logged for audit purposes
4. **Flexibility**: Works with both new inventory system and legacy system
