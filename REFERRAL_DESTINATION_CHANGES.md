# Referral Patient Destination Logic Changes

## Summary
Successfully modified the referral patient destination logic from 'to-doctor' to focus on 'Unit/Department/Specialities' instead.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Changes (`consultations/models.py`)
- **REFERRAL_TYPE_CHOICES**: Removed `('doctor', 'Specific Doctor')` option
- **__str__ method**: Removed doctor-specific destination logic
- **get_referral_destination method**: Removed doctor logic, now only handles department/specialty/unit
- **can_be_accepted_by method**: Removed doctor-specific acceptance logic
- **is_to_nhia_unit method**: Simplified to only check department-based logic

### 2. Form Changes (`consultations/forms.py`)
- **Meta.fields**: Removed `'referred_to_doctor'` from form fields
- **Meta.widgets**: Removed doctor field widget configuration
- **__init__ method**: Removed doctor queryset setup and field configuration
- **clean method**: Removed doctor referral validation logic

### 3. Template Changes

#### `consultations/templates/consultations/referral_form.html`
- Removed doctor selection section (`doctor_section`)
- Updated help information to remove doctor option
- Simplified JavaScript to remove doctor-related field toggles

#### `consultations/templates/consultations/referral_detail.html`
- Removed doctor-specific permission checks
- Updated action buttons to focus on department/specialty/unit logic

#### `consultations/templates/consultations/referral_tracking.html`
- Removed doctor-specific permission checks in action buttons
- Updated consultation start conditions

### 4. View Changes (`consultations/views.py`)
- **doctor_dashboard**: Removed direct doctor referral queries
- **referral_list**: Removed doctor referral queries and filtering
- **referral_detail**: Removed doctor-specific permission checks and follow-up logic
- **update_referral_status**: Removed doctor-specific notification logic
- **create_referral**: Removed doctor department checking for NHIA authorization

### 5. Admin Changes (`consultations/admin.py`)
- **ReferralAdmin**: Removed `'referred_to_doctor'` from search fields and fieldsets
- **ReferralInline**: Removed doctor field from inline form fields

### 6. Database Migration
- Created migration `0008_remove_doctor_referral_type.py` to update referral_type choices

## Current Referral Destination Options

After the changes, the system now supports these referral destination types:

1. **Department**: Refer to an entire department
2. **Specialty**: Refer to a specific medical specialty within a department
3. **Unit**: Refer to a specific unit (ICU, Emergency, etc.) within a department

## Features Preserved

- Department-based referral logic
- Specialty and unit referral functionality
- NHIA authorization logic (now department-based only)
- Referral acceptance by qualified doctors in target departments
- Referral tracking and status updates
- Integration with consultation system

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Simplified Workflow**: Referrals now focus on organizational units rather than specific doctors
2. **Better Resource Management**: Allows any qualified doctor in a department to accept referrals
3. **Improved Flexibility**: Departments can manage referral workload internally
4. **Maintained Authorization**: NHIA authorization logic still works for department-based referrals

## Testing

All changes have been tested and verified:
- Model choices updated correctly
- Form fields exclude doctor selection
- Templates render without doctor options
- Views handle department/specialty/unit logic only
- Database migration applied successfully
- Django system check passes
- Server starts without errors

## Usage

Doctors can now refer patients to:
- **Departments** (e.g., "Cardiology Department")  
- **Specialties** (e.g., "Pediatric Cardiology" within Cardiology Department)
- **Units** (e.g., "Cardiac ICU" within Cardiology Department)

Any qualified doctor working in the target department/specialty/unit can accept and handle the referral.
