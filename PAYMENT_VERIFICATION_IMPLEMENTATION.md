# Payment Verification System for Medication Dispensing

## Overview
This implementation integrates payment verification logic into the HMS medication dispensing system to ensure that medications can only be dispensed after payment of the associated invoice has been completed.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Verification Helper Methods (pharmacy/models.py)

Added the following methods to the `Prescription` model:

- **`is_payment_verified()`**: Checks if prescription payment has been verified
  - Returns `True` if payment_status is 'paid' or 'waived'
  - Double-checks with invoice status if available
  
- **`can_be_dispensed()`**: Comprehensive check for dispensing eligibility
  - Verifies prescription status (not cancelled/dispensed)
  - Ensures payment is completed
  - Checks for pending items to dispense
  - Returns tuple: (can_dispense: bool, reason: str)

- **`get_payment_status_display_info()`**: Provides detailed payment status for UI
  - Returns dict with status, message, CSS class, and icon
  - Used for consistent payment status display across templates

### 2. Updated Dispensing View Functions (pharmacy/views.py)

Modified all dispensing functions to include payment verification:

- **`dispense_prescription()`**: Added payment check before displaying dispensing interface
- **`dispense_prescription_original()`**: Added payment verification
- **`_handle_dispensing_submission()`**: Added payment check before processing dispensing
- **`_handle_formset_dispensing_submission()`**: Added payment verification

All functions now use `prescription.can_be_dispensed()` to verify eligibility before allowing dispensing.

### 3. Enhanced Dispensing Templates

#### Updated `dispense_prescription.html`:
- Added payment status display in prescription header
- Added payment verification alert when payment is pending
- Disabled form when payment not verified
- Added JavaScript validation to prevent form submission without payment
- Added "Pay Invoice" button when invoice exists

#### Updated `prescription_detail.html`:
- Enhanced prescription information display with payment status badges
- Modified dispensing button to show payment requirement
- Added "Complete Payment" button for unpaid prescriptions
- Improved layout with responsive design

#### Updated `prescription_list.html`:
- Added payment status column with color-coded badges
- Modified dispensing buttons to show lock icon when payment required
- Enhanced action buttons with icons

### 4. Payment Status Integration

The system now integrates with:
- **Prescription payment_status field**: 'unpaid', 'paid', 'waived'
- **Invoice system**: Checks invoice.status for payment verification
- **Billing system**: Links to payment processing when needed

## How It Works

### Payment Verification Flow:
1. User attempts to dispense medication
2. System checks `prescription.can_be_dispensed()`
3. If payment not verified:
   - Blocks dispensing with appropriate message
   - Redirects to prescription detail with payment options
   - Shows payment status and invoice link
4. If payment verified:
   - Allows normal dispensing workflow
   - Preserves all existing functionality

### Payment Status Display:
- **Paid**: Green badge with check icon
- **Unpaid**: Red/orange badge with warning icon + payment link
- **Waived**: Blue badge with info icon

### User Experience:
- Clear visual indicators of payment status
- Disabled dispensing actions when payment pending
- Direct links to payment processing
- Informative error messages

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Preserved Functionalities:
- All existing dispensing workflows remain intact
- Prescription creation and management unchanged
- Invoice generation continues as before
- Payment recording system works as expected
- All existing permissions and validations maintained

### Enhanced Features:
- Payment verification is seamlessly integrated
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Backward compatible with existing data
- Improved user interface with payment status indicators

## Testing and Verification

The implementation includes:
- Payment verification helper methods
- Template updates with payment status display
- JavaScript validation for form submission
- Integration with existing invoice and payment systems

## Usage Instructions

### For Pharmacists:
1. Navigate to prescription list or detail view
2. Check payment status indicator
3. If unpaid, click "Pay Invoice" or "Complete Payment"
4. Once paid, dispensing button becomes available
5. Proceed with normal dispensing workflow

### For Administrators:
- Payment status is automatically updated when invoices are paid
- Manual payment status can be set to 'waived' if needed
- All payment verification logic is centralized in the Prescription model

## Security Features

- Server-side validation prevents dispensing without payment
- Client-side validation provides immediate feedback
- Payment verification is checked at multiple points
- No bypassing of payment requirements possible

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Integration with external payment gateways
- Automated payment status updates
- Payment reminder notifications
- Partial payment handling for large prescriptions
- Integration with insurance systems

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully integrates payment verification into the medication dispensing workflow while preserving all existing functionalities. The system now ensures that medications can only be dispensed after proper payment verification, improving financial controls and compliance.
