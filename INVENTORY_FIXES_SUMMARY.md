## Technical Enhancements

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Transaction Safety**: All multi-step operations wrapped in `transaction.atomic()`
2. **Model Methods**: Using `purchase.update_total_amount()` instead of manual calculations
3. **AJAX Support**: Proper AJAX response handling for dynamic UI updates
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/except blocks with user-friendly messages
5. **Validation**: Status validation before operations, expiry date checks, batch number requirements
6. **Audit Trail**: Approval/rejection records for compliance
7. **Query Optimization**: Using `select_related()` and aggregate functions

### HMS Patterns Applied
- ✅ Use `title` instead of `page_title` for page titles
- ✅ Reuse variable names that templates expect
- ✅ Create audit records for approval actions
- ✅ Validate status before allowing operations
- ✅ Check permissions for sensitive operations
- ✅ Support both regular and AJAX requests

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Workflows to Test

#### Supplier Management
- [ ] Search suppliers by name, contact, email, phone, city
- [ ] Filter suppliers by active/inactive status
- [ ] View inactive suppliers
- [ ] Edit supplier details
- [ ] Deactivate suppliers

#### Purchase Management
- [ ] Create purchase with dispensary assignment
- [ ] Create purchase without dispensary
- [ ] Add items to purchase
- [ ] Edit purchase items (draft/pending only)
- [ ] Delete purchase items (draft/pending only)
- [ ] Verify total amount auto-calculation

#### Approval Workflow
- [ ] Submit purchase for approval
- [ ] Approve purchase (authorized user)
- [ ] Reject purchase with reason
- [ ] Verify cannot approve/reject without permission
- [ ] Verify approval records created

#### Transfers
- [ ] Request transfer with valid batch number
- [ ] Request transfer without batch number (should fail)
- [ ] Request transfer of expired medication (should fail)
- [ ] Request transfer with insufficient stock (should fail)
- [ ] View bulk store dashboard statistics

## Remaining Issues (Optional)

### 3 Medium Priority Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **PR-D001**: Missing database index on purchase_date
   - Type: Performance optimization
   - Impact: Slow queries on large datasets
   - Fix: Add database migration with index

2. **BS-I001**: Automatic bulk store creation
   - Type: Convenience feature
   - Impact: Manual creation required
   - Fix: Add Django signal

3. **RT-L003**: Inter-dispensary transfer uses legacy model
   - Type: Technical debt
   - Impact: Uses old `MedicationInventory` instead of `ActiveStoreInventory`
   - Fix: Requires data migration and refactoring

**Note**: These are enhancements that don't affect core functionality. The system is fully functional without them.
