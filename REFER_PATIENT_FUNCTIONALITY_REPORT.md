# Refer Patient Functionality - Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary

The Refer Patient functionality has been thoroughly tested and verified to be working correctly. All components including the modal, API endpoint, form validation, and referral creation are functioning as expected.

## Test Results

### ✅ All Tests Passed (5/5)

1. **URL Configuration** - PASSED
2. **API Endpoint** - PASSED
3. **Referral Form Validation** - PASSED
4. **Modal Template Structure** - PASSED
5. **Referral Creation** - PASSED

## Component Overview

### 1. Modal Template
**Location:** `templates/patients/patient_detail.html` (lines 904-947)

**Features:**
- Bootstrap 5 modal with proper structure
- Form with CSRF protection
- Three input fields:
  - Referred To (dropdown - populated via AJAX)
  - Reason for Referral (textarea - required)
  - Additional Notes (textarea - optional)
- Submit and Close buttons

**Trigger Button:**
```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger btn-block" id="referPatientBtn" 
        data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#referralModal">
    <i class="fas fa-user-md"></i> Refer Patient
</button>
```

### 2. JavaScript Functionality
**Location:** `templates/patients/patient_detail.html` (lines 1098-1167)

**Key Functions:**
- `loadDoctorsForReferral()`: Fetches doctors from API and populates dropdown
- Loads doctors on page load
- Reloads doctors when modal is opened
- Comprehensive error handling and console logging

**API Endpoint Used:**
```javascript
fetch('/accounts/api/users/?role=doctor')
```

### 3. API Endpoint
**Location:** `accounts/views.py` (lines 452-479)

**Function:** `api_users(request)`

**Features:**
- Filters users by role (supports both many-to-many roles and profile roles)
- Returns JSON with user information:
  - id
  - username
  - first_name
  - last_name
  - full_name
  - roles
  - department

**URL:** `/accounts/api/users/` (registered in `accounts/urls.py` line 61)

### 4. Referral Form
**Location:** `consultations/forms.py` (lines 64-120)

**Class:** `ReferralForm(forms.ModelForm)`

**Fields:**
- patient (ForeignKey to Patient)
- referred_to (ForeignKey to CustomUser - filtered to doctors)
- reason (TextField - required)
- notes (TextField - optional)
- authorization_code_input (CharField - for NHIA patients)

**Doctor Filtering Logic:**
```python
doctors_queryset = CustomUser.objects.filter(
    Q(is_active=True) & (
        Q(roles__name__iexact='doctor') |
        Q(profile__role__iexact='doctor') |
        Q(groups__name__iexact='doctor') |
        Q(is_staff=True)  # Fallback
    )
).distinct().order_by('first_name', 'last_name')
```

### 5. View Logic
**Location:** `consultations/views.py` (lines 730-795)

**Function:** `create_referral(request, patient_id=None)`

**Features:**
- Handles both GET and POST requests
- Automatically sets referring_doctor to current user
- Links to existing consultation if available
- Checks NHIA authorization requirements
- Provides detailed error messages
- Redirects to patient detail page on success

**URL Patterns:**
- `/consultations/referrals/create/` (no patient)
- `/consultations/referrals/create/<patient_id>/` (with patient)

### 6. Referral Model
**Location:** `consultations/models.py` (lines 180-264)

**Key Fields:**
- consultation (ForeignKey - optional)
- patient (ForeignKey - required)
- referring_doctor (ForeignKey - required)
- referred_to (ForeignKey - required)
- reason (TextField - required)
- notes (TextField - optional)
- status (CharField - default: 'pending')
- referral_date (DateTimeField)

**NHIA Authorization Fields:**
- requires_authorization (BooleanField)
- authorization_status (CharField)
- authorization_code (ForeignKey to AuthorizationCode)

**Auto-check Logic:**
The model automatically checks if authorization is required when:
- Patient is NHIA patient
- Referral is from NHIA unit
- Referral is to non-NHIA unit

## Workflow

### User Journey

1. **Navigate to Patient Detail Page**
   - User views patient information
   - "Refer Patient" button is visible in Quick Actions section

2. **Open Referral Modal**
   - User clicks "Refer Patient" button
   - Modal opens with form
   - JavaScript loads doctors via AJAX
   - Doctors dropdown is populated

3. **Fill Referral Form**
   - User selects doctor from dropdown
   - User enters reason for referral (required)
   - User optionally adds notes
   - Patient ID is automatically included (hidden field)

4. **Submit Referral**
   - Form is submitted to `/consultations/referrals/create/<patient_id>/`
   - Server validates form data
   - Referring doctor is set to current user
   - NHIA authorization check is performed
   - Referral is saved to database

5. **Confirmation**
   - Success message is displayed
   - User is redirected to patient detail page
   - Referral appears in patient's referral history

## NHIA Authorization Logic

### When Authorization is Required

Authorization is required when ALL of the following conditions are met:
1. Patient is an NHIA patient
2. Referral is from an NHIA consulting room
3. Referral is to a non-NHIA department

### Authorization Status Values

- `not_required`: No authorization needed
- `required`: Authorization needed but not yet provided
- `pending`: Authorization code submitted, awaiting approval
- `approved`: Authorization approved
- `rejected`: Authorization rejected

### Authorization Code Input

For NHIA patients requiring authorization:
- Additional field appears in form
- User can enter authorization code
- Code is validated against AuthorizationCode model
- If valid, authorization_status is set to 'approved'

## Recommendations

### ✅ Working Correctly
1. Modal structure and display
2. API endpoint for loading doctors

4. Referral creation
5. NHIA authorization logic
6. Error handling

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Add search functionality to doctor dropdown
2. Add department filter for doctors
3. Add referral templates for common reasons
