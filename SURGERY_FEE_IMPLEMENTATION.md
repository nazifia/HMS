# Surgery Fee Implementation - Complete!

## Summary

Successfully implemented surgery fee logic based on surgery type with NHIA discount support and replaced all dollar signs with Naira signs.

---

## 1. Surgery Type Fee Field

### **Model Changes:**

Added `fee` field to `SurgeryType` model:

```python
fee = models.DecimalField(
    max_digits=10, 
    decimal_places=2, 
    default=0.00, 
    help_text="Surgery fee in Naira (â‚¦)"
)

def get_fee_display(self):
    """Return formatted fee with Naira symbol"""
    return f"â‚¦{self.fee:,.2f}"
```

**Migration:** `theatre/migrations/0008_surgerytype_fee.py`

---

## 2. Invoice Creation Logic

### **Updated Surgery Invoice Creation:**

When a surgery is created, the invoice now includes the surgery type fee with NHIA discount:

```python
# Get surgery fee from surgery type
surgery_fee = Decimal(str(self.object.surgery_type.fee))

# Apply NHIA discount if applicable (NHIA patients pay 10%)
if self.object.patient.patient_type == 'nhia':
    patient_payable_fee = surgery_fee * Decimal('0.10')
else:
    patient_payable_fee = surgery_fee
```

**Location:** `theatre/views.py` - `SurgeryCreateView.form_valid()` method (lines 296-354)

---

## 3. Fee Structure

## 4. NHIA Discount Logic

### **Patient Type Pricing:**

- **Regular Patients:** Pay 100% of surgery fee
- **NHIA Patients:** Pay 10% of surgery fee (NHIA covers 90%)

### **Example:**

For an Appendectomy (â‚¦80,000.00):
- **Regular Patient:** Pays â‚¦80,000.00
- **NHIA Patient:** Pays â‚¦8,000.00 (NHIA covers â‚¦72,000.00)

---

## 5. Currency Symbol Updates

### **Files Updated:**

1. **dental/templates/dental/dental_services.html**
   - Changed: `${{ service.price }}` â†’ `â‚¦{{ service.price }}`

All other files already use the Naira symbol (â‚¦) through the `currency` template filter or direct formatting.

---

## 6. Form Updates

### **SurgeryTypeForm:**

Added fee field widget with proper formatting:

```python
'fee': forms.NumberInput(attrs={
    'placeholder': '0.00', 
    'step': '0.01', 
    'min': '0'
}),
```

**Help Text:** "Surgery fee in Naira (â‚¦)"

---

## 7. Population Script

### **Script:** `populate_surgery_fees.py`

**Features:**
- Populates fees for all surgery types
- Uses risk-based pricing as default
- Applies custom fees for specific surgeries
- Displays summary by risk level

**Usage:**
```bash
python populate_surgery_fees.py
```

**Output:**
```
âœ“ Appendectomy
  â””â”€ Custom Fee: â‚¦80,000.00

âœ“ Cholecystectomy
  â””â”€ Custom Fee: â‚¦150,000.00

âœ… COMPLETED! Updated 6 surgery types with fees

ðŸ“Š FEE SUMMARY BY RISK LEVEL:
Low Risk: 3 surgeries, Average Fee: â‚¦68,333.33
Medium Risk: 2 surgeries, Average Fee: â‚¦235,000.00
Critical Risk: 1 surgery, Average Fee: â‚¦350,000.00
```

## 8. Complete Surgery Billing Flow

### **Step 1: Surgery Creation**
1. User creates surgery with surgery type
2. System retrieves surgery type fee
3. System applies NHIA discount if applicable
4. Invoice is created with correct fee

### **Step 2: Pack Orders**
1. User orders medical packs for surgery
2. Pack costs are calculated
3. NHIA discount applied to pack costs (10% for NHIA patients)
