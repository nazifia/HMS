## 🎯 Quick Implementation Guide

### **For Each Department:**

**Step 1: Enhance View** (`department/views.py`)
```python
from core.department_dashboard_utils import build_enhanced_dashboard_context

@login_required
@department_access_required('DepartmentName')
def department_dashboard(request):
    user_department = get_user_department(request.user)
    
    # Build enhanced context
    context = build_enhanced_dashboard_context(
        department=user_department,
        record_model=DepartmentRecord,
        priority_field='priority',  # if exists
        status_field='status',
        completed_status='completed'
    )
    
    # Add department-specific metrics
    context.update({
        'specific_metric_1': value1,
        'specific_metric_2': value2,
        # ... more metrics
    })
    
    return render(request, 'department/dashboard.html', context)
```

**Step 2: Update Template** (`templates/department/dashboard.html`)
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% load static %}

{% block extra_css %}
<!-- Include enhanced dashboard CSS -->
{% include 'includes/enhanced_department_dashboard_base.html' with extra_css=True only %}
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<!-- Statistics Cards -->
<div class="row">
    <!-- Use enhanced stat cards with trends -->
</div>

<!-- Charts Row -->
<div class="row">
    <!-- Daily trend chart -->
    <!-- Status distribution chart -->
</div>

<!-- Urgent Items Section -->
<!-- Pending Referrals Section -->
<!-- Recent Records Section -->
{% endblock %}

{% block extra_js %}
<!-- Include Chart.js and chart creation scripts -->
{% include 'includes/enhanced_department_dashboard_base.html' with extra_js=True only %}

<script>
// Create department-specific charts
createLineChart('dailyTrendChart', {{ daily_trend.labels|safe }}, {{ daily_trend.data|safe }}, 'Records');
createDoughnutChart('statusChart', {{ status_distribution.labels|safe }}, {{ status_distribution.data|safe }}, {{ status_distribution.colors|safe }});
</script>
