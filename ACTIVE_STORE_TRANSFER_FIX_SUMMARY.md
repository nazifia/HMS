    notes = forms.CharField(required=False, widget=forms.Textarea)
```

### Views
```python
def active_store_detail(request, dispensary_id):
    # Handle dispensary transfer
    if request.method == 'POST' and 'dispensary_transfer' in request.POST:
        # Process transfer from active store to dispensary
        transfer = DispensaryTransfer.create_transfer(
            medication=medication,
            from_active_store=active_store,
            to_dispensary=dispensary,
            quantity=quantity,
            requested_by=request.user
        )

def approve_dispensary_transfer(request, transfer_id):
    """Approve and execute a dispensary transfer"""
    transfer.approved_by = request.user
    transfer.status = 'in_transit'
    transfer.save()
    transfer.execute_transfer(request.user)
```
