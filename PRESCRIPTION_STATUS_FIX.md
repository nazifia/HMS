# Prescription Dispensing Status Fix

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Prescription status not updating correctly after dispensing selected medications  
**Symptoms**:
- Success message says "all medications dispensed" even when only some were dispensed
- Prescription status doesn't change to "Partially Dispensed" when appropriate
- Status only updates to "Dispensed" when ALL items are fully dispensed
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The dispensing logic in `pharmacy/views.py` (lines 2084-2094) had incomplete status update logic:

**BEFORE (Incorrect)**:
```python
if any_dispensed:
    # Optionally mark prescription as dispensed if all items are dispensed
    remaining = prescription.items.filter(is_dispensed=False).count()
    if remaining == 0:
        prescription.status = 'dispensed'
        prescription.save(update_fields=['status'])
    messages.success(request, 'Selected medications dispensed successfully.')
```

**Issues**:
1. ❌ Only updated status to 'dispensed' when ALL items were fully dispensed
2. ❌ Never updated status to 'partially_dispensed' when some items were dispensed
3. ❌ Generic success message didn't reflect actual dispensing progress
4. ❌ Prescription could remain in 'pending' or 'approved' status even after partial dispensing

### Prescription Status Model

The Prescription model has these status choices:
```python
STATUS_CHOICES = (
    ('pending', 'Pending'),
    ('approved', 'Approved'),
    ('dispensed', 'Dispensed'),              # All items fully dispensed
    ('partially_dispensed', 'Partially Dispensed'),  # Some items dispensed
    ('cancelled', 'Cancelled'),
    ('on_hold', 'On Hold'),
)
```

### Dispensing Status Logic

The Prescription model has a `get_dispensing_status()` method that correctly determines status:
```python
def get_dispensing_status(self):
    """Get the dispensing status of the prescription"""
    items = self.items.all()
    if not items.exists():
        return 'no_items'
    
    fully_dispensed_count = items.filter(is_dispensed=True).count()
    partially_dispensed_count = items.filter(
        is_dispensed=False, 
        quantity_dispensed_so_far__gt=0
    ).count()
    total_items = items.count()
    
    if fully_dispensed_count == total_items:
        return 'fully_dispensed'
    elif fully_dispensed_count > 0 or partially_dispensed_count > 0:
        return 'partially_dispensed'
    else:
        return 'not_dispensed'
```

However, the dispensing view wasn't using this logic to update the prescription status!

## Solution Implemented

### Updated Dispensing Logic

**AFTER (Correct)** - Lines 2084-2111:
```python
if any_dispensed:
    # Update prescription status based on dispensing progress
    total_items = prescription.items.count()
    fully_dispensed_items = prescription.items.filter(is_dispensed=True).count()
    partially_dispensed_items = prescription.items.filter(
        is_dispensed=False,
        quantity_dispensed_so_far__gt=0
    ).count()
    
    # Determine the correct status
    if fully_dispensed_items == total_items:
        # All items fully dispensed
        prescription.status = 'dispensed'
        prescription.save(update_fields=['status'])
        messages.success(request, f'All medications dispensed successfully. Prescription marked as fully dispensed.')
    elif fully_dispensed_items > 0 or partially_dispensed_items > 0:
        # Some items dispensed (fully or partially)
        prescription.status = 'partially_dispensed'
        prescription.save(update_fields=['status'])
        messages.success(request, f'Selected medications dispensed successfully. {fully_dispensed_items} of {total_items} items fully dispensed.')
    else:
        # This shouldn't happen if any_dispensed is True, but handle it
        messages.success(request, 'Selected medications dispensed successfully.')
    
    if skipped_items:
        names = ', '.join([s.medication.name for s in skipped_items])
        messages.warning(request, f'Some items were skipped because they are already fully dispensed: {names}')
    return redirect('pharmacy:prescription_detail', prescription_id=prescription.id)
```

### Key Improvements

1. ✅ **Counts all dispensing states**:
   - Total items in prescription
   - Fully dispensed items (`is_dispensed=True`)
   - Partially dispensed items (`is_dispensed=False` but `quantity_dispensed_so_far > 0`)

2. ✅ **Updates status correctly**:
   - `'dispensed'` - When ALL items are fully dispensed
   - `'partially_dispensed'` - When SOME items are dispensed (fully or partially)

3. ✅ **Provides accurate feedback**:
   - "All medications dispensed successfully. Prescription marked as fully dispensed."
   - "Selected medications dispensed successfully. 2 of 3 items fully dispensed."

4. ✅ **Handles edge cases**:
   - Skipped items (already dispensed)
   - Partial quantity dispensing
   - Multiple dispensing sessions

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Partial Dispensing

**Prescription has 3 medications**:
- Medication A: 20 units prescribed
- Medication B: 10 units prescribed
- Medication C: 15 units prescribed

**User dispenses**:
- ✅ Medication A: 20 units (fully dispensed)
- ✅ Medication B: 5 units (partially dispensed)
- ❌ Medication C: Not selected

**Result**:
- Medication A: `is_dispensed=True`, `quantity_dispensed_so_far=20`
- Medication B: `is_dispensed=False`, `quantity_dispensed_so_far=5`
- Medication C: `is_dispensed=False`, `quantity_dispensed_so_far=0`
- **Prescription Status**: `'partially_dispensed'` ✅
- **Message**: "Selected medications dispensed successfully. 1 of 3 items fully dispensed." ✅

### Scenario 2: Full Dispensing

**User dispenses all remaining**:
- ✅ Medication B: 5 units (completes to 10 total)
- ✅ Medication C: 15 units (fully dispensed)

**Result**:
- Medication A: `is_dispensed=True`
- Medication B: `is_dispensed=True`, `quantity_dispensed_so_far=10`
- Medication C: `is_dispensed=True`, `quantity_dispensed_so_far=15`
- **Prescription Status**: `'dispensed'` ✅
- **Message**: "All medications dispensed successfully. Prescription marked as fully dispensed." ✅

### Scenario 3: Attempting to Dispense Already Dispensed Items

**User tries to dispense Medication A again**:

**Result**:
- Item skipped (already fully dispensed)
- **Warning Message**: "Some items were skipped because they are already fully dispensed: Medication A" ✅
- Status remains unchanged

## Files Modified

### `pharmacy/views.py` - `dispense_prescription()` function

**Location**: Lines 2084-2111

**Changes**:
1. Added comprehensive item counting logic
2. Implemented proper status determination
3. Enhanced success messages with progress information
4. Maintained backward compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Status Tracking**: Prescription status now correctly reflects dispensing progress
2. **Clear User Feedback**: Messages show exactly how many items were dispensed
3. **Better Workflow**: Staff can see at a glance which prescriptions are partially vs fully dispensed
4. **Audit Trail**: Status changes are properly recorded
5. **Prevents Confusion**: No more "all dispensed" messages when only some items were dispensed

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Dispensing all items updates status to 'dispensed'
- [x] Dispensing some items updates status to 'partially_dispensed'
- [x] Success message shows correct count (e.g., "2 of 3 items fully dispensed")
- [x] Partially dispensing an item (not full quantity) updates status to 'partially_dispensed'
- [x] Attempting to dispense already dispensed items shows warning
- [x] Multiple dispensing sessions correctly update status
- [x] Status visible on prescription detail page

## Summary

**Before**: 
- Status only updated to 'dispensed' when ALL items were fully dispensed
- Generic success message didn't reflect actual progress
- 'partially_dispensed' status was never set

**After**: 
- Status correctly updates to 'partially_dispensed' when some items are dispensed
- Status updates to 'dispensed' when all items are fully dispensed
- Success messages show exact progress (e.g., "2 of 3 items fully dispensed")

**Result**: Prescription dispensing status now accurately reflects the actual dispensing progress! ✅
