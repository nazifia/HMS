## URL Structure

```
/pharmacy/transfers/                          # Dashboard
/pharmacy/transfers/list/                     # Transfer listing
/pharmacy/transfers/single/create/           # Single transfer creation
/pharmacy/transfers/bulk/create/             # Bulk transfer creation
/pharmacy/transfers/<id>/                     # Transfer details
/pharmacy/transfers/<id>/approve/            # Approve transfer
/pharmacy/transfers/<id>/reject/             # Reject transfer
/pharmacy/transfers/<id>/execute/            # Execute transfer
/pharmacy/transfers/bulk/approve/            # Bulk approve
/pharmacy/transfers/reports/                 # Transfer reports
```

## API Endpoints

- `/pharmacy/api/check_inventory/`: Check medication availability
- `/pharmacy/api/inventory-check/`: Get inventory details

## Transfer Workflow

### 1. Creation
1. User selects transfer type (single/bulk)
2. Chooses source and destination dispensaries
3. Selects medications and quantities
4. System validates availability in real-time
5. Transfer created with "pending" status

### 2. Approval
1. Authorized user reviews pending transfers
2. Can approve individual or bulk transfers
3. System validates final availability before approval
4. Transfer status changes to "approved"

### 3. Execution
1. Transfer moves to "in_transit" status
2. Inventory is updated (source decreased, destination increased)
3. Transfer marked as "completed"
4. Audit log created

### 4. Status Management
- **Pending**: Awaiting approval
- **Approved**: Ready for execution
- **In Transit**: Being executed
- **Completed**: Successfully transferred
- **Rejected**: Cancelled with reason
- **Cancelled**: Cancelled without execution

## Key Components

### Real-time Inventory Validation
```javascript
// AJAX call to check inventory
fetch(`/pharmacy/api/check_inventory/?medication_id=${medicationId}&dispensary_id=${dispensaryId}&quantity=${quantity}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Update UI with availability
    });
```

### Bulk Transfer Formsets
```python
# Formset for bulk items
MedicationTransferItemFormSet = formset_factory(
    MedicationTransferItemForm,
    extra=3,
    can_delete=True
)
```

### Transfer Execution with Database Transactions
```python
with transaction.atomic():
    transfer.execute_transfer(request.user)
    # All inventory updates happen atomically
```

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication Required**: All transfer operations require login
- **Authorization**: Different roles have different permissions
- **Validation**: Server-side validation prevents invalid transfers
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged with user attribution
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
- **Atomic Operations**: Database transactions ensure data integrity

## Performance Optimizations

- **Select Related**: Optimized database queries
- **Pagination**: Large transfer lists are paginated
- **AJAX Validation**: Real-time feedback without page reloads
- **Caching**: Inventory data cached where appropriate
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient bulk approvals/rejections

## Mobile Responsiveness

- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive grid system
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large touch targets for mobile devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript (basic functionality)

## Integration Points

### Existing HMS Modules
- **Pharmacy**: Medication and inventory management
- **Accounts**: User authentication and authorization
- **Patients**: Patient-specific transfers (future enhancement)
- **Billing**: Transfer cost tracking (future enhancement)

### Future Enhancements
- **Transfer Scheduling**: Scheduled transfers with date/time
- **Transfer Templates**: Pre-configured transfer patterns
- **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile application
- **Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications for transfers
- **Reporting**: Advanced analytics and reporting
- **Barcode Scanning**: Mobile scanning for transfers
- **Integration**: External system integration (ERP, etc.)

## Usage Instructions

### Single Transfer
1. Navigate to `/pharmacy/transfers/`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Inventory Mismatch**: Refresh inventory data before transfer
