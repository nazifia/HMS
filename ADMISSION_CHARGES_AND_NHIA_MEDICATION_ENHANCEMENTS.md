# Admission Charges and NHIA Medication Payment Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the enhancements made to the HMS system to:
1. **Include all other patient types in admission charges auto-deductions** (not just exclude NHIA)
2. **Modify NHIA medication payment logic** to prominently display the 10% amount on templates

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Patient Types for Admission Charges

#### Before:
- Only two patient types: `regular` and `nhia`
- NHIA patients were exempt from admission charges
- Only regular patients were subject to auto-deductions

#### After:
- **Eight patient types** with comprehensive coverage:
  - `regular` - Regular patients
  - `nhia` - NHIA patients (still exempt)
  - `private` - Private pay patients
  - `insurance` - Private insurance patients
  - `corporate` - Corporate patients
  - `staff` - Hospital staff patients
  - `dependant` - Dependant patients
  - `emergency` - Emergency patients

#### Files Modified:
- `patients/models.py`: Extended `PATIENT_TYPE_CHOICES` and field length
- `inpatient/models.py`: Updated admission cost calculation logic
- `inpatient/management/commands/daily_admission_charges.py`: Enhanced with comments for clarity
- `billing/views.py`: Updated admission billing logic

#### Benefits:
- **All non-NHIA patient types** are now subject to admission charges auto-deductions
- Better categorization of patients for billing and reporting
- More flexible patient management system
- Maintains NHIA exemption while expanding coverage

### 2. Enhanced NHIA Medication Payment Display

#### Before:
- Basic display of NHIA 10% payment
- Limited visual emphasis on patient portion
- Simple pricing breakdown

#### After:
- **Prominent display** of NHIA 10% payment amount
- **Visual alerts** highlighting NHIA benefits
- **Detailed medication breakdown** showing item-by-item costs
- **Enhanced templates** with color-coded sections

#### Files Modified:
- `billing/views.py`: Enhanced context for NHIA display
- `pharmacy/views.py`: Added comprehensive pricing breakdown
- `pharmacy/templates/pharmacy/billing_office_medication_payment.html`: Major template enhancements
- `templates/billing/prescription_billing_detail.html`: Added NHIA payment alerts

#### Key Template Enhancements:

##### Billing Office Interface:
```html
<!-- Prominent NHIA 10% Display -->
<div class="alert alert-warning border-0 shadow-sm">
    <h4 class="text-warning mb-1">
        <i class="fas fa-percentage"></i> NHIA Patient - 10% Only
    </h4>
    <h2 class="text-warning mb-0">₦{{ remaining_amount|floatformat:2 }}</h2>
    <small class="text-muted d-block">Patient's 10% Contribution</small>
    <small class="text-success d-block">NHIA covers remaining 90%</small>
</div>
```

##### Medication Breakdown Table:
- Shows each medication with individual pricing
- Displays patient pays (10%) vs NHIA covers (90%)
- Color-coded for easy identification
- Totals section with clear breakdown

##### Context Variables Added:
- `nhia_patient_pays_percentage`: "10%" or "100%"
- `nhia_covers_percentage`: "90%" or "0%"
- `patient_payment_amount`: Actual amount patient pays
- `total_medication_cost`: Full medication cost
- `items_with_pricing`: Detailed per-item breakdown

### 3. Database Changes

#### Migration Created:
- `patients/migrations/0010_expand_patient_types.py`
- Extends `patient_type` field from 10 to 15 characters
- Maintains data integrity and backward compatibility

#### Applied Successfully:
```bash
python manage.py migrate patients
```

### 4. Logic Improvements

#### Daily Admission Charges Command:
```python
# Enhanced logic with clear comments
def process_admission_charge(self, admission, charge_date, dry_run=False):
    # Check if patient is NHIA - NHIA patients are exempt from admission fees
    if admission.patient.is_nhia_patient():
        logger.info(f'Patient {admission.patient.get_full_name()} is NHIA - no daily charges applied.')
        return None
    
    # Apply daily charges to all other patient types (regular, private pay, insurance, etc.)
    # This ensures that admission charges are auto-deducted for all non-NHIA patients
```

#### Admission Cost Calculation:
```python
def get_total_cost(self):
    # All other patient types (regular, private, insurance, corporate, staff, dependant, emergency) 
    # are subject to admission charges
    if is_nhia_patient:
        return 0  # NHIA patients don't pay admission fees
    # ... calculate charges for all other types
```
