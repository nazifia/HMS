  - Vaccination (`fas fa-syringe`)
- **Modals**: Physiotherapy and Vaccination request forms

### Benefits
- One-stop access to all patient services

- `MEDICAL_SERVICES_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md`

### Updated Files
- Multiple template files
- Forms in all medical modules
- Views and models in consultations app
- URL configurations

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the HMS by:
1. Making patient lookup faster and more efficient
2. Streamlining the order creation process for medical services
3. Providing one-stop access to all patient services
4. Maintaining all existing functionality while adding new features
5. Following best practices for Django development and security

The implementation is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
