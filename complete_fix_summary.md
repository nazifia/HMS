# Complete Fix Summary for Transfer Button Functionality

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Function Issue
- **Problem**: Two versions of `active_store_detail` function existed in `pharmacy/views.py`
- **Location**: Lines 925 and 2536
- **Fix**: Removed the incomplete duplicate function at line 2536
- **Result**: Only the complete version remains, which properly includes `inventory_items` in the template context

### 2. JavaScript Library Loading Order
- **Problem**: jQuery was loading after Bootstrap JS, causing JavaScript errors
- **Fix**: Moved jQuery library to load before Bootstrap JS in `templates/base.html`
- **Result**: Proper JavaScript functionality for modals and UI components

### 3. Missing JavaScript Libraries
- **Problem**: Bootstrap JavaScript libraries required for modal functionality were missing
- **Fix**: Added required JavaScript libraries to `templates/base.html`:
  - jQuery (https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js)
  - Bootstrap bundle (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js)
- **Result**: Modal functionality now works correctly

### 4. Template Structure Issues
- **Problem**: Multiple template syntax errors:
  - Duplicate modal HTML content
  - Unclosed block tags
  - Incorrect Bootstrap attributes
- **Fixes**:
  - Completely rewrote `pharmacy/templates/pharmacy/active_store_detail.html` to fix structure
  - Updated Bootstrap 4 attributes to Bootstrap 5:
    - Changed `data-dismiss` to `data-bs-dismiss`
    - Changed `data-toggle` to `data-bs-toggle`
    - Changed `data-target` to `data-bs-target`
  - Fixed block structure with proper opening and closing tags
- **Result**: Proper template rendering and modal functionality
