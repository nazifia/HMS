# Referral Display Implementation - Complete

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of automatic referral display on department dashboards with full patient details and action capabilities.

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

## 🔧 Recent Fixes

### NoReverseMatch Error Fix
**Issue:** `NoReverseMatch at /desk-office/authorization-dashboard/` - Reverse for 'detail' not found
**Root Cause:** Template was trying to render patient detail URLs without checking if patient exists
**Solution:** Added safety checks `{% if referral.patient and referral.patient.id %}` before all patient detail URL references
**Files Modified:**
- `templates/includes/department_referrals_section.html` (3 locations)
- `templates/includes/referral_detail_modal.html` (2 locations)

### Superuser Access
**Status:** ✅ Already Implemented
**Location:** `core/decorators.py` lines 28-29, 148-149, 188-190
**Details:** All decorators (`@role_required`, `@api_role_required`, `@department_access_required`) already include superuser bypass checks. Superusers have full access to all parts of the application.

## 🔄 Workflow

### **Referral Creation → Display → Action**

1. **Doctor creates referral** from OPD/Consultation
   - Selects destination department
   - Provides reason and notes
   - System checks if NHIA authorization required

2. **Referral appears on destination dashboard**
   - Automatically categorized by authorization status
   - Full patient details displayed
   - Appropriate actions available

3. **Department staff takes action**
   - **If authorized/not required**: Can accept immediately
   - **If awaiting authorization**: Must request from desk office
   - **If rejected**: Can only view details
   - **If accepted**: Can start consultation or complete service

4. **Status updates in real-time**
   - Referring doctor receives notifications
   - Audit trail maintained
   - Dashboard updates automatically
