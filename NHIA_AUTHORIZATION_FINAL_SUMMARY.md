- Consultations
- Referrals
- Prescriptions (Pharmacy)
- Laboratory Tests
- Radiology Orders

✅ **Desk Office Dashboard**
- Real-time monitoring of pending authorizations
- Quick authorization code generation
- Code management and tracking
- Statistics and reporting

✅ **Service Delivery Enforcement**
- Pharmacy cannot dispense without valid authorization
- Laboratory cannot process tests without valid authorization

## System Requirements

### Authorization Rules

**Authorization IS Required When:**
1. NHIA patient is seen in a non-NHIA consulting room
2. NHIA patient is referred from NHIA unit to non-NHIA unit

**Authorization is NOT Required When:**
1. Regular (non-NHIA) patient - regardless of location
2. NHIA patient is seen in NHIA consulting room
3. NHIA patient is referred within NHIA units

### Authorization Code Format
- Format: `AUTH-YYYYMMDD-XXXXXX`
- Example: `AUTH-20250930-A1B2C3`
- Unique, non-reusable
- Has expiry date
- Tracks usage

### Authorization Code Lifecycle
1. **Active** - Generated, not yet used, not expired
2. **Used** - Consumed by service delivery
3. **Expired** - Past expiry date
4. **Cancelled** - Manually cancelled by desk office
