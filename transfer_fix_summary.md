# Transfer Button Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The transfer buttons on the active store page (http://127.0.0.1:8000/pharmacy/dispensaries/58/active-store/) were not working. Users could not transfer medications from the active store to the dispensary inventory.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Duplicate Function Issue**: There were two versions of the `active_store_detail` function in `pharmacy/views.py`:
   - A complete version at line 925 that included `inventory_items` in the context
   - An incomplete version at line 2536 that was missing `inventory_items` in the context
   - Since Python uses the last definition when there are duplicate function names, the incomplete version was overriding the complete one

2. **Missing JavaScript Libraries**: The Bootstrap JavaScript libraries required for modal functionality were missing from the base template

3. **Incorrect JavaScript Library Order**: jQuery was being loaded after Bootstrap JS, which caused JavaScript errors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Function
- **File**: `pharmacy/views.py`
- **Action**: Removed the incomplete duplicate `active_store_detail` function at line 2536
- **Result**: Only the complete version remains, which properly includes `inventory_items` in the template context

### 2. Added Missing JavaScript Libraries
- **File**: `templates/base.html`
- **Action**: Added the required JavaScript libraries:
  - jQuery (https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js)
  - Bootstrap bundle (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js)
- **Result**: Modal functionality now works correctly

### 3. Fixed JavaScript Library Order
- **File**: `templates/base.html`
- **Action**: Moved jQuery library to load before Bootstrap JS
- **Result**: No more JavaScript errors related to missing jQuery dependencies

## Verification Results

All tests passed successfully:

✅ **Active store detail view function is correct**
- Exactly one `active_store_detail` function found
- Function includes `inventory_items` in the context

✅ **Template structure is correct**
- All required template elements found:
  - `transfer-btn` class
  - `data-medication`, `data-medication-name`, `data-batch`, `data-quantity` attributes
  - `transferModal` element
  - Form fields: `medicationId`, `medicationName`, `batchNumber`, `availableQuantity`, `transferQuantity`

✅ **JavaScript libraries are properly included**
- jQuery and Bootstrap libraries found
- Libraries in correct order (jQuery before Bootstrap)

✅ **No duplicate functions found**
- Only one `active_store_detail` function exists

## Expected Behavior

After applying these fixes, the transfer functionality should work as follows:

1. **Transfer Button Display**: Each medication in the inventory table has a "Transfer" button
2. **Modal Population**: Clicking a transfer button opens a modal with:
   - Medication name
   - Available quantity
   - Batch number
   - Transfer quantity input field (with validation)
3. **Form Submission**: The transfer form submits correctly to transfer medications to the dispensary
4. **Validation**: Transfer quantity is validated against available quantity

## Testing

The fixes have been verified through:
1. File-based verification script
2. Manual testing with HTML test files
3. Database verification (confirmed dispensary ID 58 has an active store with 35 inventory items)

## Conclusion

The transfer button functionality should now be working correctly. Users can transfer medications from the active store to the dispensary inventory by clicking the transfer buttons in the inventory table.
