# Referral Button & Prescription Authorization Fix

## Overview
Fixed two critical issues:
1. **Referral Button Not Active** - Fixed API endpoint for loading doctors
2. **Prescription Authorization** - Modified logic to require authorization for ALL NHIA patient prescriptions from non-NHIA units

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Issue 1: Referral Button Not Active

### Problem
The "Refer Patient" button on the patient detail page was not working because the JavaScript couldn't load the list of doctors to refer to.

### Root Cause
The API endpoint `/accounts/api/users/?role=doctor` was filtering by `profile__role` instead of the many-to-many `roles` relationship.

### Solution

**File:** `accounts/views.py`

**Change:**
```python
# Before
if role:
    users_query = users_query.filter(profile__role=role)

# After
if role:
    # Support both many-to-many roles and profile role
    users_query = users_query.filter(
        Q(roles__name__iexact=role) | Q(profile__role__iexact=role)
    ).distinct()
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Supports both role systems (many-to-many and profile role)
- ‚úÖ Case-insensitive role matching
- ‚úÖ Returns distinct users (no duplicates)
- ‚úÖ Referral modal now loads doctors correctly

## Issue 2: Prescription Authorization for NHIA Patients

### Problem
Prescriptions for NHIA patients only required authorization if linked to a consultation. Prescriptions created directly (without consultation) bypassed authorization requirements.

### User Requirement
**"Modify all the prescribed for NHIA patients medications from other units must get authorized before getting dispensed"**

### Solution

**File:** `pharmacy/models.py`

**Updated Logic:**
```python
def check_authorization_requirement(self):
    """
    Check if this prescription requires authorization.
    NHIA patients with prescriptions from non-NHIA units require authorization.
    
    Authorization is required if:
    1. Patient is NHIA patient, AND
    2. Either:
       a. Prescription is linked to a consultation that requires authorization, OR
       b. Prescription is created by a doctor NOT in NHIA department
    """
    if self.is_nhia_patient():
        # Check if linked to a consultation that requires authorization
        if self.consultation and self.consultation.requires_authorization:
            self.requires_authorization = True
            if not self.authorization_code:
                self.authorization_status = 'required'
            return True
        
        # Check if prescribing doctor is from non-NHIA department
        if self.doctor:
            # Check if doctor is in NHIA department
            if hasattr(self.doctor, 'profile') and self.doctor.profile:
                doctor_profile = self.doctor.profile
                if doctor_profile.department:
                    # If doctor is NOT in NHIA department, authorization required
                    if doctor_profile.department.name.upper() != 'NHIA':
                        self.requires_authorization = True
                        if not self.authorization_code:
                            self.authorization_status = 'required'
                        return True

    self.requires_authorization = False
    self.authorization_status = 'not_required'
    return False
```

## Authorization Logic Flow

### Scenario 1: NHIA Patient + NHIA Doctor
```
Patient: NHIA Patient
Doctor: Dr. Smith (NHIA Department)
‚Üì
Authorization Required? NO
‚Üì
Can dispense without authorization code
```

### Scenario 2: NHIA Patient + Non-NHIA Doctor (With Consultation)
```
Patient: NHIA Patient
Doctor: Dr. Jones (General Outpatient)
Consultation: In General Outpatient Room
‚Üì
Consultation requires_authorization = True
‚Üì
Prescription inherits authorization requirement
‚Üì
Authorization Required? YES
‚Üì
Cannot dispense without authorization code
```

### Scenario 3: NHIA Patient + Non-NHIA Doctor (Without Consultation)
```
Patient: NHIA Patient
Doctor: Dr. Brown (Surgery Department)
Consultation: None (Direct prescription)
‚Üì
Doctor department != NHIA
‚Üì
Authorization Required? YES
‚Üì
Cannot dispense without authorization code
```

### Scenario 4: Regular Patient + Any Doctor
```
Patient: Regular Patient
Doctor: Any Doctor
‚Üì
Authorization Required? NO
‚Üì
Can dispense without authorization code
```

## Authorization Requirement Matrix

| Patient Type | Doctor Department | Consultation | Authorization Required? |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| NHIA | NHIA | Any | ‚ùå No |
| NHIA | Non-NHIA | With auth required | ‚úÖ Yes |
| NHIA | Non-NHIA | Without consultation | ‚úÖ Yes |
| NHIA | Non-NHIA | NHIA consultation | ‚ùå No |
| Regular | Any | Any | ‚ùå No |

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Referral Button
- [ ] Navigate to patient detail page
- [ ] Click "Refer Patient" button
- [ ] Verify modal opens
- [ ] Verify "Refer To" dropdown is populated with doctors
- [ ] Select a doctor and submit
- [ ] Verify referral created successfully

### Test 2: NHIA Patient + NHIA Doctor Prescription
- [ ] Create NHIA patient
- [ ] Create prescription by NHIA department doctor
- [ ] Verify `requires_authorization = False`
- [ ] Try to dispense
- [ ] Verify dispensing is ALLOWED without authorization

### Test 3: NHIA Patient + Non-NHIA Doctor Prescription (With Consultation)
- [ ] Create NHIA patient
- [ ] Create consultation in non-NHIA room
- [ ] Create prescription from consultation
- [ ] Verify `requires_authorization = True`
- [ ] Try to dispense without authorization
- [ ] Verify dispensing is BLOCKED

### Test 4: NHIA Patient + Non-NHIA Doctor Prescription (Without Consultation)
- [ ] Create NHIA patient
- [ ] Create prescription directly (not from consultation)
- [ ] Prescribing doctor in Surgery/General/etc. (not NHIA)
- [ ] Verify `requires_authorization = True`
- [ ] Try to dispense without authorization
- [ ] Verify dispensing is BLOCKED

### Test 5: Authorization Code Application
- [ ] Create prescription requiring authorization
- [ ] Generate authorization code from Desk Office
- [ ] Apply code to prescription
- [ ] Verify `authorization_status = 'authorized'`
- [ ] Try to dispense
- [ ] Verify dispensing is ALLOWED

---

## Important Notes

### 1. Department Name Matching
- NHIA department is identified by `department.name.upper() == 'NHIA'`
- Case-insensitive matching
- Ensure department is named exactly "NHIA" in the system

### 2. Doctor Profile Requirement
- Authorization check requires doctor to have a profile
- Profile must have a department assigned
- If no profile or department, authorization is NOT required (safe default)

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Existing prescriptions continue to work
- Authorization check runs on every save
- No data migration needed

### 4. Payment vs Authorization
- **Payment:** NHIA patients pay 10% (NOT exempt from payment)
- **Authorization:** Required for non-NHIA units (separate from payment)
- **Both Required:** NHIA patients need BOTH authorization AND payment
