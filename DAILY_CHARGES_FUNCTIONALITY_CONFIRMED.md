## 🔧 **How the System Works**

### **1. Daily Processing Logic**
```python
# Command: python manage.py daily_admission_charges
def process_admission_charge(self, admission, charge_date, dry_run=False):
    # ✅ Check NHIA exemption
    # ✅ Validate admission/discharge dates
    # ✅ Calculate daily charge from ward rate
    # ✅ Prevent double deductions
    # ✅ Deduct from patient wallet
    # ✅ Create transaction record
```

### **2. Admission Duration Calculation**
```python
def get_duration(self):
    if self.discharge_date:
        return (self.discharge_date - self.admission_date).days
    return (timezone.now() - self.admission_date).days
```

### **3. Total Cost Calculation**
```python
def get_total_cost(self):
    # ✅ NHIA exemption check
    duration = self.get_duration()
    if duration < 1:
        duration = 1  # Minimum 1 day charge
    return daily_charge * duration
```

### **4. Wallet Deduction**
```python
wallet.debit(
    amount=daily_charge,
    description=f"Daily admission charge for {charge_date} - {ward_name}",
    transaction_type="daily_admission_charge",
    user=attending_doctor
)
```
