# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Wallet Fund Transfer feature enables secure transfer of funds between patient wallets within the Hospital Management System (HMS). This feature allows hospital staff to move money from one patient's digital wallet to another patient's wallet, with complete audit trails and validation. The system already has a robust wallet infrastructure and this feature builds upon the existing PatientWallet and WalletTransaction models to provide seamless inter-patient fund transfers.
