# NHIA Surgery Authorization Workflow Implementation

## Summary

Implemented a comprehensive authorization workflow for NHIA patients requiring authorization before medical packs can be ordered for surgeries.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Prescription Invoice Display Issue

**Problem:** Invoice was generated but prescription detail page showed "No invoice generated"

**Root Cause:** Template was checking `prescription.invoices.all|first` but the Prescription model has a OneToOneField `invoice` (singular), not a ForeignKey relationship.

**Solution:** Updated template to check `prescription.invoice` instead of `prescription.invoices.all|first`

**File Modified:** `templates/pharmacy/prescription_detail.html` (line 485-489)

```django
{% if prescription.invoice %}
    <p><strong>Invoice:</strong> <a href="{% url 'billing:detail' prescription.invoice.id %}">#{{ prescription.invoice.invoice_number }}</a> ({{ prescription.invoice.get_status_display }})</p>
{% else %}
    <p><strong>Invoice:</strong> <span class="text-muted">No invoice generated</span></p>
{% endif %}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ NHIA Surgery Authorization Requirement

**Problem:** NHIA patients could order medical packs without authorization

**Solution:** Implemented authorization check before pack ordering

**Implementation:**

#### A. Pack Order Authorization Check

**File:** `theatre/views.py` (lines 935-964)

```python
@login_required
def order_medical_pack_for_surgery(request, surgery_id):
    """Order a medical pack for a specific surgery"""
    surgery = get_object_or_404(Surgery, id=surgery_id)
    
    # Check if NHIA patient requires authorization before ordering packs
    if surgery.patient.patient_type == 'nhia':
        if not surgery.authorization_code:
            messages.error(
                request,
                'Authorization required! This is an NHIA patient. Please request and obtain '
                'authorization from the desk office before ordering medical packs.'
            )
            return redirect('theatre:surgery_detail', pk=surgery.id)
        
        # Check if authorization is still valid
        if hasattr(surgery.authorization_code, 'is_valid') and not surgery.authorization_code.is_valid():
            messages.error(
                request,
                'Authorization code has expired or is invalid. Please request a new authorization '
                'from the desk office before ordering medical packs.'
            )
            return redirect('theatre:surgery_detail', pk=surgery.id)
```

#### B. Authorization Request View

**File:** `theatre/views.py` (lines 1140-1169)

```python
@login_required
def request_surgery_authorization(request, surgery_id):
    """Request authorization from desk office for NHIA surgery"""
    surgery = get_object_or_404(Surgery, id=surgery_id)
    
    # Check if patient is NHIA
    if surgery.patient.patient_type != 'nhia':
        messages.error(request, 'Authorization is only required for NHIA patients.')
        return redirect('theatre:surgery_detail', pk=surgery.id)
    
    # Check if authorization already exists
    if surgery.authorization_code:
        messages.info(request, 'Authorization code already exists for this surgery.')
        return redirect('theatre:surgery_detail', pk=surgery.id)
    
    # Update surgery status to indicate authorization is pending
    surgery.status = 'pending'
    surgery.save()
    
    messages.success(
        request,
        'Authorization request sent to desk office. You will be notified once the authorization '
        'is approved. Medical packs cannot be ordered until authorization is received.'
    )
    
    return redirect('theatre:surgery_detail', pk=surgery.id)
```

#### C. URL Pattern

**File:** `theatre/urls.py` (line 70)

```python
path('surgeries/<int:surgery_id>/request-authorization/', views.request_surgery_authorization, name='request_surgery_authorization'),
```

#### D. Surgery Detail Template Update

**File:** `templates/theatre/surgery_detail.html` (lines 60-93)

Added authorization status display with request button:

```django
{% if object.patient.patient_type == 'nhia' %}
<div class="alert {% if object.authorization_code %}alert-success{% else %}alert-warning{% endif %} mb-3">
    <h6 class="font-weight-bold mb-2">
        <i class="fas fa-shield-alt mr-2"></i>NHIA Authorization Status
    </h6>
    {% if object.authorization_code %}
        <p class="mb-1">
            <strong>Status:</strong> <span class="badge badge-success">Authorized</span>
        </p>
        <p class="mb-1">
            <strong>Authorization Code:</strong> {{ object.authorization_code.code }}
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
            <i class="fas fa-check-circle text-success mr-1"></i>
            Medical packs can be ordered for this surgery.
        </p>
    {% else %}
        <p class="mb-1">
            <strong>Status:</strong> <span class="badge badge-warning">Pending Authorization</span>
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
            <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle text-warning mr-1"></i>
            Authorization required before medical packs can be ordered.
        </p>
        <a href="{% url 'theatre:request_surgery_authorization' object.id %}" class="btn btn-sm btn-warning">
            <i class="fas fa-paper-plane mr-1"></i>Request Authorization from Desk Office
        </a>
    {% endif %}
</div>
{% endif %}
```
