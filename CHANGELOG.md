## Unreleased

- Backwards compatibility: `/pharmacy/revenue/analysis/` (named `pharmacy:revenue_analysis`) now redirects to `/pharmacy/revenue/statistics/` (`pharmacy:simple_revenue_statistics`) and preserves query parameters. This keeps external links and bookmarks working while the statistics view is the canonical implementation.
