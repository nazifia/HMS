## Current System Status

- **Total Roles**: 9
- **Total Users**: 8
- **Users with Roles**: 8

## Quick Access Links

When logged in as an admin, you can access:

- **Role System Demo**: `/accounts/role-demo/`
- **User Management**: `/accounts/user-dashboard/`
- **Role Management**: `/accounts/roles/`
- **Create New Role**: `/accounts/roles/create/`
- **Permission Management**: `/accounts/permissions/`
- **Audit Logs**: `/accounts/audit-logs/`

## Best Practices

1. **Assign Minimum Required Roles**: Only assign roles that users actually need
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review user roles and permissions
3. **Use Role Hierarchies**: Set up parent-child relationships for related roles
4. **Monitor Changes**: Regularly check audit logs for unauthorized changes
5. **Test Permissions**: Verify that users can access what they need and nothing more

## Support
