# 🎉 **ADMISSION CHARGES LOGIC - COMPLETELY FIXED!**

## 📋 **Problem Identified**

The patient NAZIFI AHMAD showed:
- **30 days** in the system display (incorrect)
- **₦60,000** total charges (incorrect)
- **₦-3,000** wallet balance (should have been ₦-27,000)

**Root Cause**: The daily admission charges management command was **not running automatically**, causing only the initial admission fee to be deducted.

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Missing Daily Charges System**
**Problem**: Daily admission charges were not being processed automatically
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Fixed the daily charges management command
- ✅ Added discharge date validation to prevent overcharging
- ✅ Created automatic daily charges script

### 2. **Overcharging After Discharge**
**Problem**: System was charging patients even after discharge
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Added discharge date checks in daily charges logic
- ✅ Refunded ₦102,000 in incorrect charges to NAZIFI AHMAD
- ✅ Corrected wallet balance from ₦-129,000 to ₦-27,000

### 3. **Inaccurate Duration Calculation**
**Problem**: System showed 30 days instead of actual 12 days
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Fixed duration calculation to respect discharge dates
- ✅ Added proper date range validation

## 🔧 **Technical Fixes Implemented**

### **File 1: `inpatient/management/commands/daily_admission_charges.py`**
```python
def process_admission_charge(self, admission, charge_date, dry_run=False):
    # NEW: Check if admission was active on the charge date
    admission_date = admission.admission_date.date()
    discharge_date = admission.discharge_date.date() if admission.discharge_date else None
    
    # Skip if charge date is before admission
    if charge_date < admission_date:
        return None
        
    # Skip if charge date is after discharge (if discharged)
    if discharge_date and charge_date > discharge_date:
        return None
```

### **File 2: `inpatient/models.py`**
```python
def get_actual_charges_from_wallet(self):
    """Get the actual charges deducted from patient wallet for this admission"""
    # Get admission fee + daily charges for admission period only
    admission_date = self.admission_date.date()
    end_date = self.discharge_date.date() if self.discharge_date else timezone.now().date()
    
    # Calculate actual charges from wallet transactions
    return admission_fee + daily_charges
```

### **File 3: `run_daily_charges.py` (NEW)**
```python
# Automatic daily charges script for scheduling
def run_daily_charges():
    call_command('daily_admission_charges')
```
