- ✅ Follows existing codebase architecture
- ✅ Implements proper Django patterns
- ✅ Passes all system checks

## Key URLs Implemented

### Module-Specific Prescription Creation:
- `/anc/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/dental/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/ent/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/family_planning/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/gynae_emergency/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/icu/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/labor/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/laboratory/requests/<test_request_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/ophthalmic/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/oncology/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/scbu/<record_id>/create-prescription/`
- `/theatre/surgeries/<surgery_id>/create-prescription/`

### Core System Functionality:
- `/core/prescriptions/create/<patient_id>/<module_name>/`
- `/core/prescriptions/patient/<patient_id>/`
- `/core/api/medications/autocomplete/`
- `/core/notifications/`
- `/` (home page)

## Final Status

✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**
✅ **ALL MODULES ENHANCED**
✅ **SYSTEM CHECKS PASSED**
✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION**

The HMS Medical Modules Prescription Integration project has been successfully completed with all objectives met. All 12 medical modules now have consistent prescription creation capabilities, allowing healthcare providers to create prescriptions directly from patient records regardless of which medical module they are working in.

The implementation follows best practices for Django development, maintains consistency with the existing codebase architecture, and provides significant value to healthcare providers, patients, and administrators.
